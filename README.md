# cargo-delivery-simulation
BBM203 Assignment - May 2020 - first year - spring semester
<br>
<br>
In this assignment, we have implemented a cargo delivery simulation. According to this simulation,
we are given several cities. In each city, there exists a cargo station which consists of cargo
packages and cargo trucks. Our task consists of several missions. Each mission requires you to
assemble a simulated cargo truck and cargo packages at the specified city and by following the
given route, arrive at the destination city, leaving and taking cargo packages from the cities you
visit. We were expected to create a program that reads the input about the cargo packages from
the input files and after completing the missions, produces an output file exhibiting the final state
of the stations at each city.
